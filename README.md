This app was built using a clean architecture approach loosely following the official architecture guildeines from Google's [Now-In-Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid). (Basically it's a layered approach).

## Features and libraries used to build the _Snuh_ app include 
 - Gradle Version Catalogs
 - Jetpack Compose
 - Hilt for dependency injection
 - Coil for image loading
 - Accompaniest for swipe to refresh and system ui functionality
 - Kotlinx librarires: Coroutines, Serialization, Datetime
 - Ktor for networking
 - Adaptive and dynamic [themed Icons](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/icon_design_adaptive)
 - Androidx libraries for a variety of functionality including Compose Navigation, ViewModels and many others.
 - Material 3 themed (generated via [material theme builder site](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/dynamic)).
